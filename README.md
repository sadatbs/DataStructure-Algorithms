The purpose of this repository to revise and maintain my knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms
**Setup of the project is still in Progress**
**I am also learning the fundamentals and internals of TS and Node with this project**

## Execution Instructions

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have `Node.js` and `npm` (or `yarn`) installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).

   - Once you have `Node.js` installed, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

      ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - To install TypeScript globally:
      ```bash
       npm install -g typescript
       ```
   -  To compile the TypeScript files and simply run the project:
      ```bash
       npm start
       ```
